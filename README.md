### How to teach AI to play Games: Deep Reinforcement Learning - Mauro Comi

"Artificial Intelligence and Gaming, contrary to popular belief, do not get along well together. Is this a controversial opinion? Yes, it is, but I’ll explain it. There is a difference between Artificial intelligence and Artificial behavior. We do not want the agents in our games to outsmart players. We want them to be as smart as it’s necessary to provide fun and engagement. We don’t want to push the limit of our ML bot, as we usually do in different Industries. The opponent needs to be imperfect, imitating a human-like behavior."

" No rules about the game are given, and initially the Bot has no information on what it needs to do."

"Reinforcement Learning is an approach based on Markov Decision Process to make decisions."

"Traditional ML algorithms need to be trained with an input and a “correct answer” called target. The system will then try to learn how to predict the target according to new input. In this example, we don’t know what the best action to take at each state of the game is, so a traditional approach would not be effective."

"A Q-table is a matrix, which correlates the state of the agent with the possible actions that the system can adopt."
